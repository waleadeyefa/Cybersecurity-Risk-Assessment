# Cybersecurity Risk Assessment

## Objective

This project involved assessing the cybersecurity posture of a simulated client website. The objective was to identify vulnerabilities, evaluate risk levels, and provide actionable recommendations using industry-standard tools and frameworks. The focus was on aligning findings with best practices in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC).

### Skills Learned
Over a two-week period, I conducted a hands-on risk assessment of a live cloud-based web application. Key activities included:
- Researching global and industry-specific cyber threats.
- Conducting automated and manual vulnerability scans.
- Mapping findings to the OWASP Top 10 framework.
- Creating a structured risk report with mitigation strategies.
- Delivering insights and recommendations in a formal presentation.

### Tools Used

- OWASP Zap – Vulnerability scanning
- Burp Suite – Manual web and API testing
- Wireshark – Packet analysis
- OWASP Top 10 – Risk classification framework
- Google Workspace / Docs – Report and presentation creation
